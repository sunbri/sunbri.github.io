I've used Jekyll as my blog engine here and meticulously tweaked it over the years to support a bunch of features. Many folks have asked me if I would ever put my theme up for sale or distribute it more widely.

I'm happy to announce that it's now available for free and [open source](https://github.com/kaushikgopal/henry-jekyll). 

Introducing [Henry](https://github.com/kaushikgopal/henry-jekyll) - a [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/) theme with a gorgeous reading experience, chock-full of features.


# Features

To see the full list of features [check out this blog post](https://blog.jkl.gg/henry-jekyll-theme/).

## Resources

### Reporting bugs

If you have noticed something off or have bugs to file, please file them as [Github issues](https://github.com/kaushikgopal/henry-jekyll/issues). I try to stay on top of that list.

### Feature requests or questions

Want to know if Henry can support a feature, or will support one? Please use the same [Github issues](https://github.com/kaushikgopal/henry-jekyll/issues) page.

If you're not comfortable with Github you can hit me up [@kaushikgopal](https://twitter.com/kaushikgopal).

### Supporting Henry

I'm fortunate to have a job that pays me to do work that I love. I'm not in need of the financial assistance right now. 

But If you're feeling generous please donate to a charity you believe in and send me a link. That'll inspire me more than anything else to keep working on Henry.

### Do you use Henry?

Feel free to [update this README.md](https://github.com/kaushikgopal/henry-jekyll/blob/main/README.md#henry-in-the-wild) if you use Henry. It'll mean a lot to see Henry being used by creators in the wild.

[^1]: A set of tips and suggestions that help style web articles more legibly.
[^2]: He's one of the sharpest product people I know and is currently on the market. Hit him up if you're interested.
[^3]: I learnt this the hard way when the startup I worked for (Wedding Party) shuttered down. It had a burgeoning tech blog with a lot of my earliest Android content. We were acquihired and the domain had to be given away. Alas! My posts were gone. Never again, I thought to myself. 
[^4]: No more worrying about installing the right version of Ruby or Jekyll or a specific gem.
