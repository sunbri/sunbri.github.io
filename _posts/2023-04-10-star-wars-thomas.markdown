Statement from Darth Sidious:

My apprentice Darth Vader and I have been friends with Justice Thomas and his wife Ginni for almost two and a half decades. We are very dear friends. The hospitality we have extended to the Thomas’s over the years is no different from the hospitality we have extended to our many other dear friends, like Grand Moff Tarkin, Firmus Piett, and the clone troopers on whom we hone our force choke and force lightning abilities. 

We have been most fortunate to have a great life of many friends and unparalleled imperial ascendancy, and we have always placed a priority on spending time with our family and friends. Justice Thomas and Ginni never asked for any of this hospitality. 

Yes, we often fly Justice Thomas private on the Death Star for round trips between IAD (Dulles International Airport) and ISC (Coruscant Interplanetary Spaceport). But it should be noted that this is not always the case—in fact sometimes we may charter a Star Destroyer instead. Anyways, I think it’s a bit of a stretch to blame us for anything here. None of this would be a problem if you earthlings developed commercial intergalactic travel, so please hurry up. 

It is also true that Vader and I have often bantered with Justice Thomas in the Death Star’s penthouse suite. But not once have we asked about a pending or lower court case, and Justice Thomas has never discussed one. We have never sought to influence Justice Thomas on any legal or political issue. I’ve even steered clear of the whole Disney imbroglio, even though I am deeply invested in the outcome: to this day my reputation is still recovering from the damage done by their slanderous films. I think it was especially unfair to have Vader best me in _Return of the Jedi_. My superior stats in force knowledge and facial expressions should have given me the edge.

More generally, I am unaware of any of our friends ever lobbying or seeking to influence Justice Thomas on any case, and I would never invite anyone who I believe had any intention of doing that. Boba Fett is the only one of our friends who has ever expressed interest in earthly affairs, once back in 2003. He had almost joined Blackwater during the Iraq War, but was put off by their “wanton acts of violence.”

These are gatherings of friends. Last time Justice Thomas was in the galaxy we spent three weeks on the Death Star like kids in a flight simulator. Following a galaxy-wide tour, I handed Justice Thomas the wheel so he could try to break Han Solo’s long-enduring Kessel Run record. I retook control after he almost crashed us with a misguided hyperspace maneuver, as having to build a second Death Star would be nothing short of irredeemable ignominy for the Empire. We then had a blast using the superlaser to vaporize a dozen or so planets here and there. I’m sure you’ve stomped on your share of ants in your childhood years. It’s really the same thing.

On a number of occasions, Vader and I have made contributions to projects celebrating the life and legacy of Justice Thomas, just as we have done with other great leaders from Darth Plagueis to Darth Zannah. I think we are still awaiting confirmation on whether or not the latter is still _Star Wars_ canon. She was a bit before my time, so I’m just going to go with whatever you guys decide on this one.

Again, he and Ginni never asked us to do any of what we did. We did so because we believe Justice Thomas to be one of the greatest Americans of our time, with the likes of Marjorie Lee Eaton and James Earl Jones. We believe it is important to make sure as many people as possible learn about him, remember him, and understand the ideals for which he stands. That’s despite the fact that we quite disagree with him on his originalist stance. We simply enact laws as we please, and besides, I have zero recollection of what I was thinking back when I drafted the Imperial Charter.

That’s all I have to say on this matter, and I hope your questions have been answered. Also, to the Rebel Alliance, I would like to inform you that I have learned of your base on Yavin IV. Annihilation will follow shortly.
