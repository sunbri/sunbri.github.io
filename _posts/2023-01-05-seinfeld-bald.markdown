I was watching Seinfeld one evening when I came across a scene so exquisitely funny that I at once rewound the episode a few minutes just to watch it again. It was as if my brain didn’t fully believe the sitcom perfection that had just transpired and demanded an encore for confirmation. And confirmed it was. Later that night, during those 5-120 minutes of pre-slumbrous phone use, I rewatched the scene at least ten more times, falling asleep to its piquant repartee echoing in my brain case like the melody of a catchy new song.

Allow me to set the stage. Jerry is dating (tormenting) a new woman, as per usual. Her name is Lois, and her boss Duncan, happens to be an old high-school acquaintance of Jerry’s.[^1] Old wounds reopen when the former charges the latter of jumping the gun during “the big race” their sophomore year. Though Duncan speaks the truth, Jerry, ever the narcissist, simply cannot let such an accusation slide, especially not in front of Lois. He and George hatch a plan to clear his name: Jerry is to get lunch with Duncan and Lois, during which George will enter. The two will pretend to not recognize each other, and George will attest to Jerry’s version of the story.

That’s the backstory. Here’s the clip on YouTube, aptly labeled as one of the “Great Scenes in TV History”:

What struck me most about this scene besides Jason Alexander’s typically flawless acting is its inexorably deterministic trajectory. Here’s what I mean. For the determinist, once the universe sparks into existence, it issues an immutable chain of cause and effect that dictates the rest of eternity. Analogously, in this scene, once we see George gawking at Jerry like a Trekkie meeting William Shatner, the pair become two lumbering barges set on a collision course—nothing can stop the fated sequence of undermining and overreaching.

It’s an open question as to why George deliberately overacted his entrance. My take is that he wants to embarrass his friend, but I could be convinced that it’s instead a vain attempt at trying to be funny. Whatever the intentions, there can only be one outcome. Jerry, the self-styled “superficial man,” cannot afford the ignominy of having any association to the bald and stocky loser braying his name. He dismisses George’s exaggerated overtures with a puzzled shrug of the shoulders: “I’m sorry?”

Now it’s on. George, despite how much of a loser he is in real life, is a prideful man, and won’t let Jerry off so easily. Introductions hardly finish before he corners his prey with an innocuous but treacherous question: “So, what have you been doing with yourself?”[^2] With Lois and Duncan present, Jerry has no option but to tell the truth, and George pounces on him with no hesitation. He recasts himself as a member of the book-reading literati, plopping him and Jerry at opposite ends of the Harold Boom—James Corden spectrum in one fell swoop.[^3] He then dismisses Jerry’s observational comedy as little more than a tedious series of vapid “did you ever notice” statements. Jerry is caught in such a bind that he can only answer with a grudging “yeah, yeah, yeah.” That’s the coup de grâce. If only George could have channeled this genius into his actual life.

Jerry doesn’t skip a beat, however. His friendship with George has always been a cascade of taunting and one-upping, games for the psychologically deviant. I wouldn’t even be surprised if they kept score.[^4]. So in this situation, Jerry simply cannot afford to lose—it’s hardwired into his brain. Now, he can’t best George within the bounds of small talk; George has already triumphed in that domain. He instead goes straight for the jugular, throwing any pretense of propriety out the window: “Well you really went bald there, didn’t you?”, accompanied with exaggerated gestures that evoke the “thick, full head of hair” that once graced George’s crown.[^5]

Truly marvelous. There’s really not any more I can say.

What follows next is entirely expected. George takes the opportunity to add “millionaire” to his trophy case (the table knock is brilliant), and a millionaire architect at that. Jerry tries to topple this edifice of lies, and as he’s ragging on George’s canvas shoes, the two entirely have forgotten their original mission. When George starts for the door, Jerry reminds him of their scheme, having the utmost confidence that George will pull through for him. And of course George does, but not without a raunchy digression about the “voluptuous homeroom teacher.” That's true, deep friendship, expressed in a way no amount of sentimental and sickly dialogue can.

We’ve reached the end and none of it feels contrived. Having watched a considerable percentage of Seinfeld, though it’s undoubtedly one of the funniest shows I’ve ever seen, such a natural and magical moment that lasts so long (in sitcom time) without any help from the plot is nevertheless few and far between. It’s just Jerry and George and their relationship with each other, and the result is pure, natural hilarity.

[^1]: Yes, there are Superman jokes in the episode.
[^2]: I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge George's all too casual dismissal of Lois.
[^3]: Not sure if this so-called “spectrum” actually exists.
[^4]: In one of the most memorable lines of the show, Jerry lays bare his dating philosophy: “No games? What’s the point of dating without games? How do you know if you’re winning or losing?”
[^5]: I have no doubt that this is a Larry David joke.
