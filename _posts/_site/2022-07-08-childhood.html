<p><em>This essay is based on my own, personal experiences, written amid a rush of nostalgia. There were moments in our childhoods that I’m sure everyone has had, when things were not looking so great, and we fell into the caress of the abyss. I’m not going to talk about any of that in here, for better or for worse.</em></p>

<p>In a little over two weeks, I’m going to move into an apartment and start a full-time job. And with that, I know, will come the end of my childhood. For years I and countless other kids have been warned by the more hardened members of our species about this so-called “real world.” And for years it seemed like something that was forever distant, like that light at the end of a long tunnel—always a speck no matter how many steps you take in its direction. But before you know it, that speck will expand, and expand, and soon you’ll feel the sun mercilessly beating down on your head. Welcome to the real world.</p>

<p>I can’t say that I’m not scared. In fact I’m terrified. Terrified of having to go to work every day, terrified of having to do my own taxes, terrified of having to bicker with a nasty landlord. Terrified of pure, genuine, adulthood. That’s literally the reality for billions of people, you might respond, and to that I agree. But I can’t deny my feelings—they are also real, and they are a reflection of my cowardice, my naïveté, my privilege, and my doomed realization that the blissful way of life that I have been living—the only way of life I have ever known—has finally reached its expiration date. So before I take this last step across the threshold of adulthood and close the door behind me, I want to pause in this liminal moment, turn myself around, and steal just one last glance at those fun and scary and glorious days of being a child, as a child.</p>

<p>My very first memory is not some enchanting dialogue with my parents, nor some jolly adventure with a fellow toddler: it’s me cheerfully pronouncing to my grandparents, in Mandarin, that I indeed have to poop. I have often wondered why my brain chose this particular moment to inaugurate its long-term storage, but looking back now, it seems a most felicitous choice. There’s the unwarranted self-importance, the unbridled exuberance, and of course, the mention of poop, a staple in the genre of little kid humor. And I think that about sums up those earliest years of life.</p>

<p>Enter the formative elementary school years. There’s so many vivid memories. The first day of kindergarten. Discovering that my friend from first-grade lives only three houses down from me. Climbing into the sewer tunnel in my backyard. Playing freeze tag during recess. Catching frogs and toads in the woods. Waking up before my parents on the weekends to go downstairs and watch whatever was on Nickelodeon and play Pokémon on my DS. Reading <em>Magic Tree House</em>. Dialing 911 on an apparently unplugged phone and hiding when the cops show up. Wondering why the sky is blue, why everyone else is taller than me, and why the goddamn tooth fairy never showed up to my house. And the list goes on.</p>

<p>Those were the years of youthful exuberance, the years when ignorance truly meant bliss. Nothing really mattered back then, regardless of what our melodramatic ten-year-old minds believed. We were never going to marry that girl down the street, nor were we ever going to fight that kid who cut us in line. Our anger at a friend would subside the next day and our lost basketball would be replaced with a brand new one by the end of the week. We were the center of the universe, and it seemed that the universe (or in many cases our parents) took care of us: carefree living at its finest.</p>

<p>There’s a sense that everything changes come middle school and high school. That’s true in many ways, as adolescence is surely a different beast. We endure the crucible of puberty, discover our own sexuality, and develop a nascent social awareness, an awareness that the contours of our hair and the brands of our socks may actually matter. But these are still the years of childhood. Just think about it—what really happened during those youthful times? The endless cat and mouse of teenage relationship drama, the turbulent bus rides of school field trips, and the superabundance of unabashedly crude jokes. Of course it was not all so rosy, given the rampant bullying and backbiting, not to mention the tyranny of the cliques. But above all of this petty nonsense, it was a time of growth, bonding, and exploration, of meeting up at Denny’s in the middle of the night, of cramming for exams I should’ve studied for weeks before, of vibing for hours and hours with my closest friends. Because at the end of the day, we were all just kids.</p>

<p>College: the last hurrah. Sure, there was more responsibility to take on, but it was nothing that hadn’t been done before—doing the laundry, cleaning my room, maybe even cooking a little. But more importantly, and I am quite sure of this, it was the most free that I ever have been, and probably ever will be. Academics, admittedly, probably took up much more time than I had hoped, but that doesn’t detract at all from those magical four years during which I had the license to do whatever the hell I wanted. I could go with my friends to pick up slightly above average pizza at 2AM, haunt the nearby pumpkin patch with my girlfriend, lose all of my money playing poker, complain to unsuspecting listeners about the futility of life, or spend five hours a day watching my suitemates play Bloons Tower Defense. And I would wake up the next morning knowing that all of these options and more were once again readily available, that my friends were just a short walk away, just as excited as I am to see what lies ahead on this new, unsullied day. Happy times.</p>

<p>There’s a constant strand that strings together those years of life from my very first memory to these last few weeks before my new job. I can’t quite place my finger on it, but I know it’s there, and I know it relates to a most essential question: what is childhood all about? I’m not looking for a scientific or an academic answer, naturally, but instead one that simply feels right, something that has to do with that idyllic coalescence of freedom, levity, and unadulterated joy. And honestly, I don’t think there’s anything better than saying that childhood, for me at least, is exactly what I have written above.</p>

<p>One of the classic clichés of the English language roughly goes as follows: “You don’t know what you have until it’s gone.” Like most clichés, though it’s overused, it still contains a kernel of truth. So perhaps I can’t really know what being a child is about right now, as I have yet to take that last step into the world of permanent adulthood. But when the time comes, I will reflect, and I will find out. For just like those brilliant, sublime constellations of the night sky, my childhood will always be there, unreachable, yet shining all the same.</p>
