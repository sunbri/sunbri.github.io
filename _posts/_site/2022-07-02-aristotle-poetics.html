<p>Originally, this post was going to have three parts, one for each of Sophocles’ three Theban plays: <em>Antigone</em>, <em>Oedipus Rex</em>, and <em>Oedipus at Colonus</em>. I soon discovered that I am simply too slow of a writer to complete anything of that sorts in a reasonable amount of time, so I then decided to focus solely on <em>Antigone</em>, and in particular, the tragic arcs of Antigone and Creon. When I was prewriting, I found a quote from Aristotle’s <em>Poetics</em> that I wanted to use, which I did. As that literary-theoretical(?) section slowly grew into its own beast, I realized that I would never complete anything if I didn’t force myself to stop the drafting process, so I cut out almost everything <em>Antigone</em>-related and now what we’re left with is some stuff about Aristotle’s <em>Poetics</em>. The resulting argument is much less interesting than what it could’ve been, and probably has at least a few holes. Oops.</p>

<p><strong>The Aristotelian Theory</strong></p>

<p>Aristotle’s <em>Poetics</em>, according to Wikipedia, is the “first extant philosophical treatise to focus on literary theory.” Much of the work has been lost to history, and almost all of what has survived concerns Attic tragedy. For the remainder of this post, I will analyze some of what the <em>Poetics</em> has to say about crafting the perfect tragic hero. I’ll only be citing two paragraphs (from <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/poetics.1.1.html">this</a> English translation), but even that is more than enough material to ruminate on.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> We’ll begin with the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A perfect tragedy, should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan. It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation. It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity: for this moves neither pity nor fear; it merely shocks us. Nor, again, should the downfall of the utter villain be exhibited. A plot of this kind, would, doubtless, satisfy the moral sense, but it would inspire neither pity nor fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves. Such an event, therefore, will be neither pitiful nor terrible. There remains, then, the character between these two extremes—that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error or frailty (Part XIII).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s a long one, but it’s worth dissecting. Aristotle posits that the emotional aim of tragedy is to elicit in the spectators a catharsis of pity and fear. There’s no way to justify this assumption, but I’m sure most of us can agree, at the very least, that tragedy and pity—the feeling “aroused by unmerited misfortune”—should be inseparable bedfellows. And fear, in this case, carries a connotation closer to terror, a “terrible” realization that a variation of what’s playing out onstage could very well happen to “a man like ourselves.” It seems reasonable that tragedy should arouse this brand of fear.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>  Moving forward, Aristotle then censures two character arcs for failing to live up to tragic expectations: the “virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity” and the “downfall of the utter villain.” As these two extremes mark the boundaries of what counts as an acceptable tragic hero, it is worth scrutinizing their respective shortcomings in detail.</p>

<h3 id="the-virtuous-man">The Virtuous Man</h3>

<p>The destruction of the “virtuous man,” Aristotle writes, “moves neither pity nor fear; it merely shocks us.” Such a statement may feel a little off target. It is natural to view the misfortunes of the virtuous—whether due to an “act of God” or the malicious offense of some wrongdoer—as essentially tragic, arousing a flood of pity for the victims and a fear that such a fate could one day be our own, sensations directly at odds with Aristotle’s claims. The only way to salvage his argument, it seems, is to mire ourselves in an endless and fruitless debate over the definitions of “pity” and “fear,” which I’d really like to avoid.</p>

<p>So let’s do that, and direct our attention to a word that has quietly slipped under the radar: “virtuous.” Now, I don’t know Ancient Greek, unfortunately, so instead of appealing to the source text the best I can do is pull up an English definition of the word in the American Heritage Dictionary:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>virtuous</strong>, <em>adj</em>. <br /> <strong>1</strong>. Having or showing virtue, especially moral excellence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What we’ve discovered, to no one’s surprise, is that the “virtuous man” is the moral man. And if the hallmark of the moral man is that they always make the right decision, then their downfall brings up a question of just deserts: a paragon of virtue, tautologically, does not deserve any of the misfortune that the omnipotent poet can burden them with. It is this omission of causation, culpability, and responsibility that mars the quality of the pity and fear that the spectators feel in such situations. And so we are led to another section of the <em>Poetics</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As in the structure of the plot, so too in portraiture of character, the poet should always aim either at the necessary or the probable. Thus a person of a given character should speak or act in a given way, by the rule either of necessity or of probability; just as this event should follow that by necessary or probable sequence. It is therefore evident that the unraveling of the plot, no less than the complication, must arise out of the plot itself . . . (Part XV).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When we watch a play, we want the events that unfold onstage to happen for a reason—they should be “the necessary or the probable.”<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> The reason for this, I think, is the following: random and indiscriminate dismantling of the protagonist shatters the belief that there is some sort of order in the universe, that there is some mystical and cosmic force that rewards the virtuous and condemns the wicked. Though such an attitude may seem irrational and naïve in our post-Enlightenment era, it was certainly the norm for those living in Ancient Greece.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> From their corpus of myths to the epics of Homer, we’ve learned that their gods held human emotions and (usually) governed with a sense of justice. To destroy the “virtuous man,” then, is to deny the power of the Greek pantheon. And that is unacceptable.</p>

<p>Now we can return to that original paragraph from the <em>Poetics</em> and look at it from a new angle. When Aristotle writes that the tragic hero’s misfortunes should be “brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error or frailty,” what we notice is the implicit role of responsibility, that their agonies are in some way correlated with the “error or frailty” of their actions. Without such a link, the play would no longer be tragic, but instead only unreasonable and unbelievable, a procession of existential sorrows that “merely shock us.”</p>

<h3 id="the-utter-villain">The Utter Villain</h3>

<p>Onto the “downfall of the utter villain.” Aristotle objects to this device on the grounds that it elicits neither pity nor fear.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> I’m sure we can all agree with the lack of pity in such a scenario, but let’s ponder over why there is a lack of fear. There’s two possible explanations: (1) Aristotle holds a tremendously warm view of humanity—although people may make grave mistakes, they never stoop down to the level of the “utter villain”, or (2) no person ever views themselves as such. Now I’m quite optimistic about humanity myself, but I’m fairly certain that (2) is the implied argument here. The play is meant to be judged by spectators—in the Greek case during the annual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysia">Dionysia</a>—and hence their feelings are paramount. If the people don’t identify with the character, then they don’t. There’s no fear. End of discussion.</p>

<p>But there’s a fairly significant phrase in the text that I’ve skipped over: the undoing of the villain, Aristotle writes, will doubtlessly “satisfy the moral sense.” And this is another thing we can all agree on. Call it karma, poetic justice, or whatever—one simply cannot resist the schadenfreude of watching the wrongdoer’s demise, whether it happens in real life or on the stage. This fiendish delight, however, is exactly what the veteran poet avoids arousing. Maybe I’m just speaking for my own twisted mind here, but I feel it’s easy for even a twinge of schadenfreude to dominate my feelings, relegating all other emotions to the backseat, including those tragic sensations of pity and fear. As humans we are seemingly pre-packaged with an innate desire to see that the world is just, and it is precisely because this proclivity is so overriding that the tragedian must steer clear of the “downfall of the utter villain” lest the play become a parable rather than a tragedy.</p>

<h3 id="the-goldilocks-zone">The Goldilocks Zone</h3>

<p>The quintessential tragic hero, then, lies somewhere between the virtuous man and the utter villain. They are “not eminently good and just,” and someone “whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error or frailty.” Herein lies the ultimate challenge of the tragic poet: finding the narrow Goldilocks zone where the tragic hero must fall. The hero should be condemned, but not as a villain. They can be exalted, but not as a paragon. They must be faulty, but not evil, respectable, but not incorruptible. They’ll do wrong and pay for it, and we will pity them.</p>

<p>I honestly can’t think another way to put it without resorting to specific examples.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> I was originally going to write about how both Antigone and Creon from Sophocles’ <em>Antigone</em> represent the archetypal tragic hero, though to reach such a conclusion one should try to put themselves in the shoes of a 500 B.C. Athenian when reading the play. There was a much stronger loyalty to the state back then than what many of us may be comfortable with today, and that certainly colors the reading of the play.</p>

<p>I’ll leave you with one last thought. You might think, after all of this, that <em>Oedipus Rex</em>, the doomed tale of Oedipus’ discovery of his own identity, doesn’t fit into this theory at all. What, if any, of Oedipus’ misfortunes attributable to his intentions? Is he not the definition of a virtuous man who falls from grace, from exalted king to blind exile? I believe I have an answer to these questions, but it should be something pretty interesting to think about.</p>
