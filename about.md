Hi! I'm Brian. I hope to use this place to keep track of my thoughts.
This [GitHub Pages][pages] site runs on [Jekyll][jekyll], and the theme is
[Henry][henry] by Kaushik Gopal. Since I lack creativity and
imagination, I restyled the colorscheme and font to resemble [Aaron
Swartz's weblog][swartz], which I find quite pleasing to the eye.
